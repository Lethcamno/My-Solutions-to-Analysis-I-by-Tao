# My Solutions to Analysis I (Tao, 4th Edition)
#### About
The book can serve as a good first mathematics text for someone who has some basic familiarity with proofs. It is written for people interested in the foundations of Analysis, so look elsewhere if you are uninterested in learning how to derive the rules of arithmetic from the Peano Axioms, or in spending 254 pages before seeing a derivative. Those who press on will enjoy Tao's inimitably clear explanations, and an exposition whose every part fits together like clockwork.

As someone who came to mathematics via philosophy, I chose the book because of its endearing commitment to get the student "on the bottom of things", thereby making the conceptual foundations of Analysis, and the axiomatic approach to rigorous mathematics, crystal clear.

Alternatives pitched to those who could begin Tao but who are put off by the slow start include [Binmore](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mathematical-Analysis-Straightforward-Approach-Binmore/dp/0521288827), which is aimed at those who are more concerned with applications, and [Pugh](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mathematical-Analysis-Undergraduate-Texts-Mathematics/dp/144192941X), which provides lots of geometrical intuition.
